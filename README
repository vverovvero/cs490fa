This is the current unidirectional path tracer I have implemented as part of my study into path tracing theory.

The cairo image library is currently installed on my personal machine (MacOSX), and the code can be compiled with:
gcc -std=c99 -o main -L/usr/local/lib/cairo/ -lcairo main.c -I/usr/local/include/cairo/

To compile on a different machine, you will need to have cairo correctly installed.
